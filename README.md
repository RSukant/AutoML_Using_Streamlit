# Machine Learning Application with Streamlit
A comprehensive machine learning application built using Streamlit, Scikit-Learn, Plotly, and MLflow. This application enables users to upload a dataset, train a machine learning model, make predictions, visualize data, and track experiments.

## Features
- Data Upload: Upload CSV files to use as the dataset.
- Model Training: Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model on the uploaded dataset.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model and display metrics such as accuracy and classification report.
- Data Visualization: Visualize data correlations using interactive Plotly charts.
- Experiment Tracking: Track experiments and log metrics using MLflow.
- Prediction: Make predictions using the trained model based on user inputs.
- Profile Page: Display personal information and project details.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Core programming language.
- Streamlit: Framework for creating interactive web applications.
- Scikit-Learn: Library for machine learning algorithms.
- Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- Plotly: Library for interactive data visualizations.
- MLflow: Platform for managing the ML lifecycle.
